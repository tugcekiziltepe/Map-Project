# Map-Project
## Introduction
In this project, I implemented several data structures such as quadtrees, ternary search trees and algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for routing on a real-world problem. Map data is freely available from the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). I built the backend.

## Overview
My application will allow a user to use their web browser to interface with the web server which will offer similar services to Google Maps (displaying a map, scrolling, zooming, and routing) through an HTML file.
The frontend code, dataset and starter code (coding template) have been provided to me; hence, I will only work on coding the back end server which does all the mapping and routing work.
